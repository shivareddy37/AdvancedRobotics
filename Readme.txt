The project is an advanced robotics class project where a path for 2DOF robotic arm is programed avoiding Obstacles.
The cartesian palne is first converted to theta plane for the robot and then higher order trajectory planning equations are used to find an optimal path for the robotic arm.
The documentation folder contains the problem statement and the project report expalning the code and flow in detail.
